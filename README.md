# Project A
Project A is a prototype tower defense game heavily inspired by pvz. Keep in mind that this is not a complete game and will have some bugs and will be, more or less, somewhat unpolished. This project was made as a learning experience.

Built with Unity.

# Installation
Download and unzip the latest .rar file from the Releases, then run the Project A.exe
